#Installing GIT

For installing GIT in your system follow below steps:

1. Download GIT setup and start installation

2. (Only once while setting up) Initalize a local repo using command -
	git init ( This creates a .git file in the setup directory of your system)

3. (Only once while setting up) Create a link between local(own machine) and server(github server) using command - 
	git remote add origin url ( Here origin is the local and url is of github project)

4. For adding all files in git staging area use command -
	git add .

5. For commiting files in git staging area use command -
	git commit -m " Comment" (Comment can be added for understanding the commit and tracking it)

6. For Pushing files in git repository use command -
	git push -u origin master (master is the github server)

7. To check the status of git commands use -
	git status (This displays the state of working directory and staging area , i.e which changes ahve been staged and which are                      pending for stage)

8. To check the logs of git use -
	git log ( This shows the status of commit history , project history)

************************************************************

* Before initiating any git project always perform below command -
	git pull (This will bring sync between github project and local)
	Pull will bring all files from master to origin finds the difference and merges the updates in current branch thus creating a        updated file in local. 
	This bring the local branch up-to-date with its remote version.

* git fetch is a similar command but  does not merges the updates .
* git merge is followed after git fetch for merging .

***************************************************************

+ Post creating new project in git hub if we want to copy contents of old project ue command -
	git clone

+ git rebase ?
